    "In the hackathon, you will receive a dataset and a metric and you will have to set up and optimize a model for the given metric. You will have learned all the necessary bits and pieces to accomplish this task by then, nevertheless, it can still seem a daunting task. Solving a hackathon is a multistep task with multiple possible solutions and so a much bigger problem than any of the exercises in the exercise notebooks.\n",

    "This SLU is meant to help you prepare for it. You can practice all that you learned in the first part of the S01 specialization, in SLUs 01-10. You should first get to know your dataset (exploratory data analysis - EDA) and then set up the first model.\n",

The topic might be from an area completely unfamiliar to you, but this is normal in data science. Data scientists often work on very different problems and each time have to learn a bit about the background to deliver a good solution. Of course, in a hackathon, you'll have little time to explore the topic, but you can always ask the instructors."
